- With a lifetime experience with data analytics, I am a highly motivated Data enthusiast with a passion for predictive analysis. I am well skilled with Python and SQL, along with a solid statistics knowledge. 
Throughout my academic and professional career, I have a bachelor and master of Industrial engineering from the best universities of Iran (Sharif university with QS rank 0f 334). I moved to Italy with a personal interest of continuing a second master of ‘Tourism management’ essentials. As I was well prepared for data analysis, I found a full-time job in Rome for about Ten months in the AGHC company. Thanks to the lessons of Mr. Alessandro Pavan and Mr.  Gianluca Longo, respective directors of revenue department, and the trust of Mr. Moretti, I served as the only data scientist and revenue analyst there. I demonstrated a commitment to excellence and a strong work ethic. My solid background of statistics and data analysis, pushed me tto seek further. Therefor I quit the company to learn Python and SQL to jump in the next level and to be able to implement my knowledge using the most used skills in data analysis world. I passed professional certifications in “Python for Data Analytics” and “SQL for Data Analytics”, both of which are demonstrable in my Github account. 
As a current data analyst and future Data scientist, I am passionate about applying descriptive and predictive analytics, using different methods of machine learning and statistics especially Regression which is my specialty. As it can be seen on my GitHub, I studied some real-world projects using Python libraries like scikit-learn library to apply a diverse range of Machine learning and statistics classes. 
Of course, my experience of running a Two-Sided pharmaceutical start-up platform, has shaped well my mind and my decision-making procedures. Below please find my work and academic experience:
