- I am an Industrial Engineer and a passionate BI and Data Analyst with solid experience in data analysis, modeling, reporting, and visualization. I possess advanced skills in SQL, SSMS, PostgreSQL, Python, Power BI, Power Query, DAX, Excel, and statistics.
During my master’s studies in Rome, I held a full-time position as a Data Analyst at AG Hotel Consulting. In this role, I had two primary responsibilities. 1- Developing and managing all databases, including maintenance, data modeling, and creating new databases. 2- Data analysis, which involved delivering actionable insights through custom reports, maximizing revenue via dynamic pricing strategies, and preparing accurate budget forecasts.
Beyond analysis, my experience as co-founder and CEO of Darookoo (LLC), a bilateral pharmaceutical platform I launched during my Industrial engineering master at Sharif University of Technology, has strengthened my strategic thinking and decision-making skills.
